    "1. **Exception Chaining:** This allows exceptions to propagate through multiple layers of a program without losing information about their origins. When one exception is caught and another is raised in response, the new exception can now store the original exception as its __cause__ attribute. This makes it easier to debug and diagnose issues that occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception Context:** This allows additional information to be included in an exception to provide more context about what went wrong. When raising an exception, it's now possible to include an optional context parameter that provides additional information about the cause of the exception. This context information can be accessed from the exception object's __context__ attribute. This feature makes it easier to diagnose issues by providing more detailed information about what caused the exception to occur."

With class-based exceptions, you can define hierarchies of exceptions and catch exceptions at different levels of the hierarchy, depending on the context of the error. This allows you to write more expressive and maintainable code that can handle a wider range of error conditions.\n",
