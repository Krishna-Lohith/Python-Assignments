    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be extended by other classes, but is not meant to be instantiated on its own. An abstract superclass typically contains abstract methods that do not have an implementation, but instead define a contract or a set of requirements that its subclasses must fulfill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a common interface and behavior that can be shared by multiple subclasses. By defining a contract in the abstract superclass, the subclasses are required to provide their own implementation of the methods defined in the contract, which ensures that they all have a consistent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass can also contain concrete methods that provide a default implementation for some of the methods in the contract. These methods can be overridden by the subclasses if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of an abstract superclass allows for greater code reuse and maintainability, as well as improved flexibility and extensibility of the codebase.\n",
