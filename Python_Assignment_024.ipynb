This recursive call will eventually converge towards the base case of n=0, at which point the function will start returning values back up the call stack until it returns the final result.\n",

As each recursive call creates a new stack frame on the call stack, deeply nested recursive calls can quickly consume a large amount of memory, leading to stack overflow errors. To avoid this, it is important to design recursive functions in a way that minimizes the number of recursive calls needed and ensures that each recursive call eventually reaches the base case."

    "Coding functions is a fundamental part of programming, and it's important to follow certain design guidelines to ensure that your functions are well-structured, maintainable, and reusable. Here are some general design guidelines to consider when coding functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A function should have a clear and singular purpose. It should do one thing, and do it well. If a function is responsible for too many things, it can become difficult to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep functions small: Small functions are easier to read, understand, and test. They also tend to be more reusable, as they can be composed together to solve larger problems. Aim for functions that are no more than 20-30 lines long, although this can vary depending on the complexity of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use meaningful and descriptive names: Functions should have names that clearly communicate their purpose and functionality. Avoid using names that are too generic or too specific. A good function name should describe what the function does, not how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use comments and docstrings: Comments and docstrings can help explain the purpose, inputs, and outputs of a function. They can also help other developers understand how to use and interact with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use input validation: Validate the input parameters to your function to ensure they are of the correct type and within acceptable ranges. This can help prevent unexpected errors and improve the robustness of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize side effects: A function should ideally have no side effects, which means that it does not modify any external state or variables. This can help prevent unintended consequences and make your code easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't repeat yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicating code within and across functions. Instead, use abstraction and modularization to reuse code and reduce redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test thoroughly: Test your functions thoroughly to ensure they work as expected in all possible scenarios. This can help prevent bugs and ensure the reliability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these general design guidelines, you can create functions that are clear, reusable, and maintainable, making your code more robust and easier to work with over time."

    "Output parameter: A function can modify the value of an output parameter passed by reference. This is often used when a function needs to return multiple values or when the return value alone is not sufficient to communicate the result to the caller.\n",

    "Side effect: A function can modify the state of a global variable or object that is visible to the caller. However, this approach should be used with caution, as it can make the code harder to reason about and may cause unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: A function can raise an exception to indicate an error or exceptional condition. The caller can then catch the exception and take appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callback: A function can take another function (known as a callback) as an argument and call it to communicate a result. This approach is often used in event-driven programming, where the callback function is called when a certain event occurs.\n",
