    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to organize and structure code using objects, which are instances of classes. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects that have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods or functions), and it allows for abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOP enables developers to create reusable and modular code that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale. With OOP, code can be organized into logical and independent components that can interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, and changes to one component do not affect others as long as the interfaces are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of using OOP in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Code can be reused by creating objects of a class in different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Data and methods that belong together can be encapsulated within a class, making the code easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, reducing the amount of code needed to create new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Different objects can be used interchangeably, even if they have different implementations, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
