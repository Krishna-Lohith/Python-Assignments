    "Text files are files that contain human-readable text, consisting of letters, numbers, symbols, and other characters. They are typically created and edited using text editors like Notepad or Microsoft Word. In contrast, binary files are files that contain machine-readable data, such as compiled code, images, video, and audio files. These files are not human-readable, and can only be interpreted by specific programs or applications. Binary files are typically created using software development tools, such as compilers or image editors. The main difference between text and binary files is that text files store data as plain text, while binary files store data as a series of binary digits or bits. This means that text files can be easily read and edited by humans, while binary files require specialized software to interpret and manipulate the data."

This can cause problems when reading or writing binary data between different machines or systems with different architectures. Another issue is that reading and writing binary data requires more care and precision than working with text data, as a small mistake can corrupt the binary data and make it unreadable. Additionally, binary data can be harder to read and understand compared to text data, which can make debugging and troubleshooting more difficult."
